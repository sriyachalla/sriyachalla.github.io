        <p><strong>Narrative:</strong> The Titanic Kaggle competition project was an opportunity to delve into the world of machine learning through historical data. The challenge centered around predicting survival outcomes for the passengers of the Titanic, using a range of features such as class, sex, age, and fare. By applying classification algorithms and data wrangling techniques, the project aimed to uncover the underlying patterns that influenced survival rates during this tragic event.</p>
        <p><strong>Usability:</strong> This project is an exemplary use case of machine learning in historical data analysis. The insights gained from the survival predictions can be applied to modern scenarios such as risk assessment, customer behavior analysis, and decision-making processes in various industries. It serves as a testament to the power of data science in extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets.</p>
